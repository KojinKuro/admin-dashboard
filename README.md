# Admin Dashboard
CSS Grid Admin Dashboard

## 📝 Description
This is a project focusing on using CSS Grid to develop an fake admin dashboard site. The dashboard was the UI for some back end software running on a server. Through completing this project, I learned where using CSS Grid was better, and other places where Flexbox would have been a more useful solution. In the future, I would like to make the site interactive instead of a static page that doesn't do anything.
