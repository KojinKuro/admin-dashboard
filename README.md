CSS Grid Admin Dashboard

## Description
This is a project focusing on using CSS Grid to develop a website. Through doing this I learned where using CSS Grid was better, and other places where Flexbox would have been a more useful solution. In the future, I would like to make the site interactive insâ—Šead of a static page that doesn't do anything.
